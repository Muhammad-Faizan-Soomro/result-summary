## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Through this project I was able to strengthen my grip on CSS Grid.

### Continued development

I ended up creating lots of classes due to using vanilla CSS. I am learning Tailwind CSS. Once I get confident using Tailwind CSS, I will surely rebuild this project using Tailwind CSS.

### Useful resources
